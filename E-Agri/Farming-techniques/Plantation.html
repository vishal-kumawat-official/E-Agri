<b>Plantation farming is a large-scale agricultural system focused on the cultivation of cash crops such as tea, coffee, rubber, sugarcane, palm oil, and bananas. It involves the establishment of extensive monoculture plantations where crops are grown for commercial purposes. Plantation farming has been historically associated with tropical and subtropical regions due to favorable climate conditions and soil suitability for specific crops.
</b>
</p>
<p>1. Monoculture: Plantation farming predominantly relies on monoculture, where large areas of land are dedicated to growing a single crop species. This concentration allows for efficient management, uniform harvesting, and specialized cultivation practices tailored to the specific requirements of the crop.
</p>
 <p>2.Commercial Focus: The primary objective of plantation farming is commercial production for domestic and international markets. Cash crops cultivated in plantations are typically high-value commodities with significant demand and market value, driving profitability for plantation owners and investors.
      </p> 
        <p>
    3. Large-Scale Operations: Plantation farms are characterized by their extensive landholdings, often spanning hundreds or thousands of hectares. The scale of operations enables economies of scale, mechanization, and efficient resource utilization, contributing to higher productivity and profitability.
   </p> 
   <p>4. Intensive Management: Plantation crops require intensive management practices to optimize yield, quality, and sustainability. This includes irrigation, fertilization, pest and disease control, pruning, and harvesting techniques tailored to the specific crop species and plantation conditions.
      </p> 
        <p>5.Labor Intensity: Plantation farming historically relied on large labor forces, including hired workers, indentured laborers, and, in some cases, forced labor or slavery. While mechanization has reduced labor requirements in some modern plantations, labor-intensive tasks such as harvesting and field maintenance still require significant workforce engagement.
        </p>
         <p>
         6. Infrastructure Development: Successful plantation farming requires the development of extensive infrastructure, including irrigation systems, roads, storage facilities, processing plants, and worker housing. Investment in infrastructure is essential to support efficient operations, transportation logistics, and value-added processing activities. </p>
